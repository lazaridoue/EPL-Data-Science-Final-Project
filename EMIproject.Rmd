# Introduction

<p> The English Premier League is the top league of England's football, with 20 teams fighting to be crowned the English champions. Premier League was founded in 1992, and it became widely known around the world due to its strong financial support and global broadcasting. One season in The English Premier League begins in August and ends at the end of May. Each team plays with each other on home and away games. For each game, each team gets awarded 3 points for a win, 1 point for a draw, and no points for a defeat. Manchester United has won the title 13 times, Chelsea has won it 5 times, and Manchester City has won it 4 times so far. The top 4 teams of the season are promoted to compete in the Champions League. The next 3 are competing for the participation in the Europa League competition, and the last 3 teams are moved to relegation. </p>
</p> In our data science project, we will analyze data from the last 2 seasons, one of which has not been completed yet. The 2 seasons are 2018-2019 and 2019-2020 season. Our idea is to work on predicting the standings of the clubs at the end of the season 2019-2020 for the English Premier League. Some of the research ideas we are going to include are, which team is most likely to win the current season of the Premier League, and which are most likely to be the top 5 teams in the standing. In addition to that, we are going to closely study whether scoring the most goals get titles for the team and if there exists a home advantage for the games played on the home field. </p>
<p> Our team chose to work on a topic about The English Premier League because football is a sport that we have invested personal interest in, as we enjoyed playing and watching football. Additionally, due to COVID-19, like other activities, the English Premier League 2019-2020 season has been put on hold which has left football fans suspenseful. As enthusiastic football fans, we would like to use the knowledge that we have acquired in the data science class to predict outcomes that would have happened in the 2019-2020 season of The English Premier League if there had not been a global pandemic of the COVID-19. </p> 

# Data 
This is where we imported the data. We imported 5 files. 4 of these files were datasets which helped us decide the outcome of the 2020 season. We had data from the 2018, 2019, 2020 premier league season. We also had a datset for games left for the top 10 teamsin 2020.For these datasets we had to clean the data. We had datasets from these seasons that had missing information and some very important information for predicting the winner of the 2020 season. We had to delete the uneccesary columns and keep the important data. We had missing information that was very key for finding our final answers such as goal differentials, total points, and chances missed and much more. We found the inforamtion needed and made a new spreadsheet and filled in the data to meet our needs and this was how we cleaned the data to get what we needed.
```{r imports}
# Add needed libraries, import all needed data, and show glimspses of all data here
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
EPL_18<-read_excel("2018 Top 10.xlsx")
EPL_18$GD <- c(EPL_18$Goals-EPL_18$GC)
EPL_19<-read_excel("2019 Top 10.xlsx")

EPL_20<-read_excel("2020 Top 10.xlsx")
EPL_20$GD <- c(EPL_20$Goals-EPL_20$GC)

Home_Away <- read_excel("Games Left Top 10.xlsx")

glimpse(EPL_19, width = 3)

glimpse(EPL_20, width = 3)

```
head(EPL_18) is containing the table from the 2018 season. This season Manchester City won with 100 points. No other team seems to be close to the champions of this season. This table shows the stats from the top 10 finishing teams from the 2018 season.

head(EPL_19) is showing once again that Manchester City finihsed with 98 points in the season which made them champions. Liverpool was only 1 point behind the champions meaning the title was between them two all season. 

head(EPL_20) is showing the current standings of the 2020 season. This season was supposed to be over a while ago but due to Covid-19 the season was delayed and will begin June 17th. This table shows the amount of games each team has played and their stats. Liverpool is on top with 82 points with a big gap between second place team Manchester City with 57 points. We are using this tables stats to compare them to the past seasons to predict the outcome for this table. 

# Primary Write-up

We are mainly using the teams past data in order to predict the teamâ€™s performance. We used the datasets available from https://www.kaggle.com/thesiff/premierleague1819 and https://www.kaggle.com/idoyo92/epl-stats-20192020, which consists of all the results from 2018-2020, compiled into CSV files. The next step was to discover the dominating factors that interact well with team strength.

## Key Outcomes
